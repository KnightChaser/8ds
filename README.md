- **Manual Balance**: Two sliders to set left/right channel volume (0‚Äì100%).
- **8D Auto-Panning**: A toggleable mode that sweeps audio balance in a smooth sine wave.
- **8D Intensity Cap**: Slider to cap maximum 8D effect, preventing jarring 100% swings.
- **Single-File Executable**: Packaged with PyInstaller into `8ds.exe`.

## Download
Download the Windows `8ds` binary from [Releases](https://github.com/KnightChaser/8ds/releases).

## Build

1. Clone the repo and enter the directory:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/KnightChaser/8ds.git
cd 8ds
```

2. Install dependencies (Suppose you create a Python virtual environment named `.venv`):
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Build the EXE:
```powershell
.\build.ps1
```

4. Run:
```powershell
.\build\8ds.exe
```
(Alternatively, simply `python .\src\main_gui.py` for immediate execution without EXE packaging.)

## Usage

* `Interface` label shows the audio endpoint you are currently using.
* `Left / Right` sliders adjust channel volumes when 8D is **`off`**.
* `Enable 8D Audio` toggles auto-panning; sliders deactivate.
* `8D Max (%)` slider sets the peak balance swing when 8D is **`on`**.
